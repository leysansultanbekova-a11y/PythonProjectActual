#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have created the base of the grid and the words, and figured out how to make the grid interactive so the user is able to choose boxes within the grid. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Grouping the 4 groups of 4 words and figuring out how to display whether the user's picks were incorrect or correct. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far, I haven't really bumped into issues that I couldn't solve or figure out.
